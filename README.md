cute graphics scripting with oF and luaJIT

minimal sandbox for scripting 2d graphics using lua binded to some oF function, very opinionated workflow. 

Includes different lua namespaces:

- `px` for drawing shapes and lines and general control 
- `lfo` for cyclic animations 
- `png` for loading and displaying folders of .png images 
- `font` for drawing text

For Lua scripting i'm using [ofxLua](https://github.com/danomatika/ofxLua), that i just tweaked a bit.    
A build of [luaJIT](http://luajit.org/) 2.0.5 for linux64 is included, for other systems you have to build it yourself and put the compiled library into `libs/luaJIT/lib/yourplatform`.
